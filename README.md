# CCTicker

Get last prices from Bitstamp and show if you are rich, or not.

## Usage

Create a ``config.json`` file from ``config.json.sample`` with your precious holdings.

Then launch ``./ccticker`` and pop the Champagne, or the "mousseux".

## Config file

The sample file should be self explanatory. Currencies supported are those of Bitstamp. You can switch the FIAT currency from USD to EUR if you speak Le Fromage.
